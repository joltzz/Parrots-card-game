# Parrots-card-game
I don't know what happened to my PC, but i lost some of my files when tried to install linux, so i had to make this project in another computer. 
This project consists in a memory card game with parrots, when you click a card it is supposed to flip and it shows you the front card and you win the game by matching all of them.
